        <h3>Welcome to Pinko</h3>

<p>Pinko is a distributed expression engine targetting Azure Cloud.  The project is written in C# and F# (expression engine). 
The overall architecture is open source.  The F# expression engine is not open source.  The open source project contains a mock expression engine for sample purposes only. </p>

<p>Pinko is in early stages of development (Aug 2012) and not ccompleted at this point.  You can set up a watch on our project to keep track of our progress.  </p>

<h3>RoadMap</h3>

<p>The goal is to create a processing engine that processes user provided formulas in realtime across multiple Azure worker roles. </p>

<p>Pinko delivers real-time datafeed via <a href="https://github.com/SignalR/SignalR">SignalR</a>. Initial version will include some sample formulas, but as the project grows it will include a full featured Windows 8 front end with Telerik controls. </p>

<h3>Sample Expression</h3>

<p>Think of Pinko as an Excel formula processor available in the cloud. A couple of sample expressions follow:  </p>

<p><em>=RForm("Symbol", "IBM", "Price.Bid", "Reuters") * 2</em></p>

<p>Pinko monitors the IBM price bid. Every time a new Price.Bid arrives, the formula is recalculated and streamed into the client. </p>

<p><em>=RHist("Symbol", "IBM", "Price.Bid", "Reuters", "Min", 360) - RHist("Symbol", "IBM", "Price.Ask", "Reuters", "Min", 360)</em></p>

<p>RHist() retrieves 360 minutes calculates the Bid/Ask spread. Every time a new tick arrives, the formula is recalculated.</p>

<h3>The Cool Stuff</h3>

<p>So we have just another expression engine, but imagine creating a historical charts on demand with your own formulas, not pre-canned averages or spreads like other systems.  </p>

<p>Pinko allows users to create formulas for trade ideas, color grids, ladders, historical charts, and any other analysis graphics.</p>
