The project is written in C# and F# (expression engine). \r\nThe overall architecture is open source.  The F# expression engine is not open source.  The open source project contains a mock expression engine for sample purposes only. \r\n\r\nPinko is in early stages of development (Aug 2012) and not ccompleted at this point.  You can set up a watch on our project to keep track of our progress.  \r\n\r\n### RoadMap\r\nThe goal is to create a processing engine that processes user provided formulas in realtime across multiple Azure worker roles. \r\n\r\nPinko delivers real-time datafeed via [SignalR](https://github.com/SignalR/SignalR). Initial version will include some sample formulas, but as the project grows it will include a full featured HTML5/AJAX front end with Telerik Kendo controls. \r\n\r\nRealtime feeds are feed via Azure CDN, and other cloud base components for optimal scalabilty and availability. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Sample Expression\r\nThink of Pinko as an Excel formula processor available in the cloud. A couple of sample expressions follow:  \r\n\r\n_=RForm(\"Symbol\", \"IBM\", \"Price.Bid\", \"Reuters\") * 2_\r\n\r\nPinko monitors the IBM price bid. Every time a new Price.Bid arrives, the formula is recalculated and streamed into the client. \r\n\r\n_=RHist(\"Symbol\", \"IBM\", \"Price.Bid\", \"Reuters\", \"Min\", 360) - RHist(\"Symbol\", \"IBM\", \"Price.Ask\", \"Reuters\", \"Min\", 360)_\r\n\r\nRHist() retrieves 360 minutes calculates the Bid/Ask spread. Every time a new tick arrives, the formula is recalculated.\r\n\r\n### The Cool Stuff\r\nSo we have just another expression engine, but imagine creating a historical charts on demand with your own formulas, not pre-canned averages or spreads like other systems.  \r\n\r\nPinko allows users to create formulas for trade ideas, color grids, ladders, historical charts, and any other analysis graphics.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
